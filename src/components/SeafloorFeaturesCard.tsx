                  ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview: seafloor features were identified based on
                  geomorphology, which classifies features using depth, seabed
                  slope, and other environmental characteristics. Plans should
                  ensure the representative coverage of each seafloor feature
                  type. This report summarizes the percentage of each habitat
                  that overlaps with this plan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  üéØ Planning Objective: include the recommended % of each
                  feature type at minimum. The target % varies by feature type.
                </p>
                <p>
                  üó∫Ô∏è Source Data: Seamounts and knolls were identifed using
                  Yesson et al., 2021. Other geomorphological features were
                  identified using Harris et al., 2014. Seamounts were buffered
                  an additional 40km beyond their natural extent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  üìà Report: The percentage of each feature type within this
                  plan is calculated by finding the overlap of each feature type
                  with the plan, summing its area, then dividing it by the total
                  area of each feature type found within the EEZ. If the plan
                  includes multiple areas that overlap, the overlap is only
                  counted once.
